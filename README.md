# COVID-19 modelling

## Get started

### Setup
Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data
I haven't found a clean way of getting the data.
For now I manually download the excel from here:

## Run
Currently, the script `main.py` only parses a local excel file and plots the data in a bar chart.

We will later move towards using notebooks for experiments and rather use the pure python code as a lib.
